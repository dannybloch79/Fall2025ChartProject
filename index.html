    <h1> How Data on 'Limited' English Speakers in One Brooklyn Community District Reveals a Linguistic Richness  </h1>
    <!-- DEK/SUBHED -->
    <h3> In the neighborhoods of Community Board 11, getting the word out requires awareness of just how linguistically diverse its residents are </h3>
    <!-- BYLINE -->
    <p><h3>NEW YORK, Nov. 29, 2025 | By Danny Bloch</h3></p> 

    
    <!-- STORY STARTS HERE -->
    <p> Brooklyn’s CB11 includes Bensonhurst, Bath Beach and parts of Gravesend and Mapleton. As with other parts of the City, these neighborhoods are sometimes described using a short-hand based on who is perceived to be the main ethnic/linguistic community. Bensonhurst, for its part, is often described as a historically Italian place that is now largely Chinese.
</p>

    <p>What do the numbers say? Data from the NYC Civic Engagement Commission considers the languages spoken by “Limited English Proficient” New Yorkers, and reveals that over 46% of CB11 residents are considered “LEP” - the sixth highest percentage in the City among CBs. 
</p>

    <p>As the chart below explores, a majority (92%) of “LEP” residents in CB11 speaks one of eight languages, with speakers of Chinese languages accounting for more than half of the top eight language speakers, followed by those who speak Spanish or Russian. “LEP” speakers of Italian represent 4%, perhaps suggesting that there are fewer immigrants from Italy who have arrived more recently compared to CB11 residents hailing from countries where Chinese, Spanish and Russian are spoken.

    <!-- WRAPUP THE STORY HERE -->
    <p>Zak Amin, a 30-year-old pharmacist living in Bensonhurst, puts his awareness of CB11’s linguistic diversity into practice. Amin is the founder of Crescent Health, which is in the process of applying to become the first Islamic faith-based volunteer ambulance service in the City. To inform the application, Amin is drawing on responses to an online survey he started last year for Muslim New Yorkers living in CB11 to share their experiences accessing healthcare. 
    </p>
    <p>Amin handed out cards with QR codes linking to the survey that he printed in      Albanian, Arabic, English, Russian, Urdu and Uzbek. Amin says responses number in the “thousands,” and the goal is to “gather data from everybody because we do have non-English speakers here, and that’s the whole point - to be inclusive.”
